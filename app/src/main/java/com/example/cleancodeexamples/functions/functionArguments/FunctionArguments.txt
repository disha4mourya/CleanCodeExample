The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic).
Next comes one (monadic),
followed closely by two (dyadic).
Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible.
More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.


includeSetupPageInto(newPageContent) -> includeSetupPage()

Testing:
With more than two arguments, testing every combination of appropriate values can be daunting

Output arguments are harder to understand than input arguments

One input argument is the next best thing to no arguments.
