Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both.

public boolean set(String attribute, String value);
    if (set("username", "unclebob"))...

The author intended set to be a verb, but in the context of the if statement it feels like an adjective.
adjective - a word that tells us more about a noun
verb- a word used to describe an action, state, or occurrence.

rename: setAndCheckIfExists
if (attributeExists("username")) {
    setAttribute("username", "unclebob"); ...
}
